# Lec 06 - Wildcards

## Wildcards

**Motivation:** In Java, **wildcards** (`?`) are used in generics to create more flexible and reusable code by allowing **parameterized types** to operate on **a range of types**, rather than a single specific one.

**Bonus**: As we have seen in [lec-05-generics](../lec-05-generics/ "mention"), Java Generics are **invariant**. But if we add wildcards (`?`) to Generics, it will have some **variance** relationship.

For example,

```java
// Circle <: Shape
// A<? extends Circle> <: A<? extends Shape>
```

### Upper-Bounded Wildcards

An _upper-bounded wildcard_ allows a generic type to accept **any subtype** of a specified class or interface `T`. This is useful when you want to read data from a generic structure and ensure that you're working with a specific base type or its subclasses.

<details>

<summary>Why is it called upper-bounded?</summary>

This is because the wildcard `?` is bounded above by `T`, which means that `?` <: `T`. (a.k.a `T` is an upper-bound of wildcard `?`)

</details>

For example,

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
public void copyFrom(Seq<? extends T> src) {
  int len = Math.min(this.array.length, src.array.length);
  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      this.set(i, src.get(i));
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Here, the Line 4 serves to read data from a generic structure. Here, what `copyFrom` does is to copy every element from another sequence called `src`, which is `Seq<? extends T>`, to the `Seq<T>` field in the current class.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each of the element from `src` should be of type `? extends T`, which is obviously a subtype of `T`.
{% endhint %}

#### Variance Relationship: Covariance

The upper-bounded wildcard has the following subtype relations:

1. If `S` <: `T`, then `A<? extends S>` <: `A<? extends T>` (covariance)
2. For any type `S`, `A<S>` <: `A<? extends S>`

#### Explanation

Let's use the knowledge we have seen in [Lab 01](../../lab/lab-01-logistics-introduction-to-oop-exercise-0.md#subtype-relation).

> subtype is nothing but a subset

For the Covariance Rule 1,

1. `A<? extends S>` represents the subset containing every type that is a subtype of `S` (denote this subset as $$X$$).&#x20;
2. Similarly, `A<? extends T>` represents the subset containing every type that is a subtype of `T` (denote this subset as $$Y$$)
3. Since `S` <: `T`, we can intuitively see that the relationship between $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is that $$X\subset Y$$.
4. So, we can use "subtype is nothing but subset" again to deduce that `A<? extends S>` <: `A<? extends T>`.

For the Covariance Rule 2,

1. `A<S>` is a subset with a **single** element, which is type `S` (deonte this subset as $$X$$)
2. Similarly, `A<? extends S>` represents the subset containing every type that is a subtype of `S` (denote this subset as $$Y$$).&#x20;
3. We can intuitively see that the relationship between $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is that $$X\subset Y$$.
4. So, we can use "subtype is nothing but subset" again to deduce that `A<S>` <: `A<? extends S>`.

#### Corollary

1. **Substitutation principle:** If `S` <: `T`, then `A<S>` <: `A<? extends T>`.
2. **Transitivity:** If `S` <: `T` and `T` <: `U`, then `A<S>` <: `A<? extends U>`.

### **Lower-Bounded Wildcards**

A _lower-bounded wildcard_ allows a generic type to accept any **supertype** of a specified class `T`. This is particularly useful when you want to **write** data to a generic structure and ensure that the structure can **accept** objects of a specific type or its subclasses.

<details>

<summary>Why is it called lower-bounded?</summary>

This is because the wildcard `?` is bounded below by `T`, which means that `T` <: `?`. (a.k.a `T` is a lower-bound of wildcard `?`)

</details>

For example,

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
public void copyTo(Seq<? super T> dest) {
  int len = Math.min(this.array.length, dest.array.length);
  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      dest.set(i, this.get(i));
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Here, Line 4 serves to **write** data to a generic structure. Here, what `copyTo` does is to copy every element in the `Seq<T>` field in the current class to the another sequence called `dest`, which is `Seq <? super T>`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each element from `dest` should be of type `? super T`, which is obviously a supertype of `T`.
{% endhint %}

#### Variance Relationship: Contravariance

The lower-bounded wildcard has the following subtype relationship:

1. If `S` <: `T`, then `A<? super T>` <: `A<? super S>` (contravariance)
2. For any type `S`, `A<S>` <: `A<? super S>`

#### Explanation

Similarly as we have seen above, we can use the knowledge from [Lab 01](../../lab/lab-01-logistics-introduction-to-oop-exercise-0.md#subtype-relation) again

> subtype is nothing but a subset

For the Contrariance Rule 1,

1. `A<? super S>` represents the subset containing every type that is a **supertype** of `S` (denote this subset as $$X$$).&#x20;
2. Similarly, `A<? super T>` represents the subset containing every type that is a **supertype** of `T` (denote this subset as $$Y$$)
3. Since `S` <: `T`, we can intuitively see that the relationship between $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is that $$Y\subset X$$.
4. So, we can use "subtype is nothing but subset" again to deduce that `A<? super T>` <: `A<? super S>`.

For the Contrariance Rule 2,

1. `A<S>` is a subset with a **single** element, which is type `S` (deonte this subset as $$X$$)
2. Similarly, `A<? super S>` represents the subset containing every type that is a **supertype** of `S` (denote this subset as $$Y$$).&#x20;
3. We can intuitively see that the relationship between $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is that $$X\subset Y$$.
4. So, we can use "subtype is nothing but subset" again to deduce that `A<S>` <: `A<? super S>`.

#### Corollary

1. **Transitivity:** If `S` <: `T` <: `U`, then `A<? super U>` <: `A<? super T>` <: `A<? super S>`.

### PECS Rule

"PECS" stands for "Producer Extends; Consumer Super". Basically this rule states that:

* **Producer** (provides data): Use upper-bounded wildcards `? extends T` to read[^1] from it. So `T` must encompass (`≥`) the producer’s type.
* **Consumer** (accepts data): Use lower-bounded wildcards `? super T` to write[^2] to it. So `T` must fit inside (`≤`) the consumer’s type.

{% hint style="info" %}
PECS is usually used on **method parameter**. So, one easy way for you to think is that:

1. Take the method parameter as your "studyObject"
2. look at the `studyObject.method()`
3. If `.method()` is something like `get(), read()`, then your studyObject is a **producer**, add **lower-bounded wildcard** to your method parameter.
4. If `.method()` is something like `set(), write()`, then your studyObject is a **consumer**, add **upper-bounded wildcard** to your method parameter.
{% endhint %}

### Unbounded Wildcards

An **unbounded wildcard** (`?`) means "I don’t know what the type is." It is used when we want to work with **any type** but don’t need to specify a relationship (subtype or supertype).

For example,

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
void foo(Seq<?> seq) {
   :
  x = seq.get(0);
  seq.set(0, y);

}
```
{% endcode %}

Here, the type of `x` can only be `Object` since it's the only safe choice. For, `y` it becomes even more restrictive, it must be `null`.

So, for a `Seq<?>`, we have the following principles,

* We **cannot add** anything to `seq`, except `null`, because we don’t know the exact type.
* We **can read** from it, but the elements are treated as `Object`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`Seq<?>` is different from `Seq<Object>`, where the latter is **not** the supertype of any parameterized type `Seq<T>`, `Seq<Object>` is just a **parameterized type** of `Seq<T>` where `T` is `Object`.
{% endhint %}

#### Variance Relationship

1. `A<?>` is the **supertype** of every **parameterized type** of `A<T>`, that is `A<T>` <: `A<?>`.

#### `Seq<?>`, `Seq<Object>` and `Seq`

* `Seq<?>` is a sequence of objects of some specific, but unknown type;
* `Seq<Object>` is a sequence of `Object` instances, with type checking by the compiler;
* `Seq` is a sequence of `Object` instances, without type checking.

### Revisit Raw Type

#### **The Problem with Raw Types and Generics**

Java's generics (like `List<String>`) lose their type information during compilation due to "type erasure." This causes two main issues:

* **Type Checks:** You can't reliably check specific generic types at runtime (e.g., `instanceof List<String>` won't work).
* **Arrays:** You can't directly create arrays of specific generic types (e.g., `new List<String>[10]` is invalid).

#### **Old Solution - Raw Types**

Previously, Java allowed you to:

* Use raw types (without generics) for these cases:
  * `instanceof` checks: `a instanceof ArrayList` (instead of `ArrayList<String>`)
  * Array creation: `new ArrayList[10]` (instead of `ArrayList<String>[10]`)

#### **New Solution - Unbounded Wildcards (`<?>`)**

Instead of raw types, we now use `<?>` (unknown type) to handle both scenarios better:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**For** `instanceOf` **checks**

```java
if (a instanceof ArrayList<?>) { ... }
```

* The `<?>` explicitly tells readers: "We're checking if it's an ArrayList of _any type_."
* This works because `<?>` matches the erased type (just like raw types), but it's clearer and safer.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**For Array creation**

```java
Comparable<?>[] arr = new Comparable<?>[10];
```

* `Comparable<?>` is considered a "reifiable" type (its type info isn't lost during compilation).
* This allows safe array creation while still using generics.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### **Why This Matters**

* **Clarity:** `<?>` clearly communicates "any type" instead of silently dropping generics (raw types).
* **Safety:** Discouraging raw types helps avoid accidental type errors in your code.
* **Modern Java:** Newer Java versions encourage using wildcards (`<?>`) over raw types.

{% hint style="success" %}
Always use `<?>` instead of raw types when you need to check generic types with `instanceof` or create arrays of generic classes.
{% endhint %}

### Revisit Type erasure

> This is a continued discussion on [#type-erasure-process-in-java](../lec-05-generics/#type-erasure-process-in-java "mention")

Since during the type erasure, all the generic type parameters information will be erased, the first step remains unchanged, that is **the generic type will be erased to its rawtype**.

### Wildcard is not a type

1. `?` (which is the wildcard notation) **cannot** be used as [**type argument**](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]**!**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**we cannot use `?` when instantiating a generic type**

For example, the following code **doesn't work**!

```java
private static final Box<?> emptyBox = new Box<?>(null);
```

Instead, we should write as follows,

```java
private static final Box<?> emptyBox = new Box<>(null);
```

In this case, the compiler will do the type inference and conclude that the type argument will be `Object`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**we cannot use `?` in generic type declaration**

For example, the following is **not allowed**!

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
class A<?> {
    :
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**we can use `?` to instantiate** **an array of generics**

As we have seen [#revisit-rawtype](./#revisit-rawtype "mention"), we can use **unbounded wildcards** to instantiate an array of generics. For example,

```java
Box<?>[] arr = new Box<?>[10];
```

This means that we tell the compiler, I want an array of boxes, but I don't care what I put inside those boxes.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Type Inference

Type inference in Java is the compiler's ability to _automatically determine_ (deduce) the **type arguments** for [generic methods](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] **based on the context** where they are used.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Type Inference** happens usually because when you are **parameterizing** the **generic methods** or **generic types**, you didn't provide the **type arguments**. Thus, it needs to deduce them using some rules.
{% endhint %}

### Rule to find the constraints

When doing Type Inference, form your constraints in the following ways

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Target: \_\_ <: \_\_**

This means "the return type of the method" <: "the type of the variable you are assigning to"
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Argument: \_\_ <: \_\_**

This means "the type of the **argument**" <: "the type of the **parameter**"
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Bound: \_\_ <: \_\_**

This means we need to consider "the bound of the generic type parameters"
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

For example, the following is our background,

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
class Fruit implements Comparable<Fruit> {
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Fruit f) {
        return 0; // stub
    }
}

class Apple extends Fruit {
}

List<Fruit> fruits = List.of(new Fruit(), new Apple());
List<Apple> apples = List.of(new Apple(), new Apple());

static <T extends Comparable<T>> T max(List<T> list) {
    T max = list.get(0);
    if (list.get(1).compareTo(max) > 0) {
        return list.get(1);
    }
    return max;
}
```
{% endcode %}

If we use the following command, what will the `T` in `max` be inferred as?

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Fruit f = max(fruits);
```
{% endcode %}

1. **Target**: `T` <: `Fruit`
2. **Argument:** `List<Fruit>` <: `List<T>`. Due to invaraince of generics, `T` must be `Fruit`
3. **Bound**: `T` <: `Comparable<T>`

By combing these three constraits, we can see that `T` will be inferred as `Fruit`.

### Rule to solve the constraints

We now summarize the steps for type inference. First, we figure out all of the **type constraints** on our type parameters by using the [rule](./#rule-to-find-constraints) above, and then we **solve these constraints**. If no type can satisfy all the constraints, we know that Java will fail to compile. If in resolving the type constraints for a given type parameter `T` we are left with:

* `Type1 <: T <: Type2`, then `T` is inferred as `Type1`
* `Type1 <: T`, then `T` is inferred as `Type1`
* `T <: Type2`, then `T` is inferred as `Type2`

where `Type1` and `Type2` are arbitary types.

[^1]: sometimes it is called "get", any word that has similar meaning works.

[^2]: sometimes it is called "set", any word that has similar meaning works.

[^3]: this means that the following rules apply to the time when we try to instantiate something containing generics

[^4]: this usually happens when we call the **constructor** of a generic type.
