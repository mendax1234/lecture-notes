# Lec 03 - RISC-V ISA and Microarchitecture

As ISA is just architecture (see [Harris & Harris](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/ddca-notes/textbook/from-zero-to-one#abstraction)!), so this lecture will talk about the architecture and microarchitecture part of RISC-V!

## RISC-V ISA

As we have already seen in [Harris & Harris](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/ddca-notes/textbook/architecture)'s introduction to architecture, we first recap some important points regarding architecture and microarchitecture.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Architecture

This is the programmer's view of computer. And it has the following features:

* Defined by instructions & operand locations
* **Assembly language**: human-readable format of instructions
* **Machine language**: computer-readable format (1’s and 0’s)
* Assembly language -> Machine language conversion is done by the assembler
  * one to one correspondence (except for pseudo-instructions)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Microarchitecture

This is about how to implement an architecture in hardware (we will see later in [second half](lec-03-risc-v-isa-and-microarchitecture.md#risc-v-microarchitecture) of this lec series)
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### RISC-V Features

In the lec, we have introduced some interesting features about RISC-V, and they are as follows,

* As a RISC architecture, the RISC-V ISA is a load-store architecture, which means only load/store variants can access memory
  * No mixing of memory access with data processing or branching

{% hint style="warning" %}
Memory and register is **not the same**! Here, memory usually refers to the main memory.
{% endhint %}

* Interesting design choices to simplify hardware implementation
  * Especially the encoding of immediates (We will see later).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Instruction length and word length are not necessarily the same!
{% endhint %}

Below are some very interesting points starting from the **instruction length vs. word length**.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Instruction Length vs. Word Length

The **word length** of a processor is the width of its registers/ALU or the size of most elements in its datapath. For example, the following are three types of Risc-V processors,

* **RV32** → word length = 32 bits (registers and ALU are 32-bit wide).
* **RV64** → word length = 64 bits.
* **RV128** (rare, theoretical) → word length = 128 bits.

The **instruction length** is the number of bits to encode an instruction and it is determined by the ISA encoding design and extensions included. For example,

* Base ISA (RV32I, RV64I, RV128I) → instructions are **always 32 bits long**.
* If you add the **Compressed (C) extension**, some instructions are **16 bits long**.
* There are also **48-bit and 64-bit instruction encodings** in the RISC-V spec (for special extensions).

{% hint style="warning" %}
In a 32-bit (word length) system, the instruction length **doesn't** have to be 32-bit.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### What if word length and instruction length doesn't match?

* **Instruction length ≠ word length**
  * A 32-bit processor does not mean all instructions must be 32 bits long. This is what we have seen from above.
  * Example: ARM Thumb and RISC-V compressed (`C`) extension use 16-bit instructions on a 32-bit processor.
  * The processor’s frontend (fetch/decode) handles variable instruction sizes, while the backend (execution units, registers, ALU) still works on 32-bit data.

{% hint style="success" %}
The idea of frontend and backend of a processor is very important and we will come back to it in the [microarchitecture](lec-03-risc-v-isa-and-microarchitecture.md#risc-v-microarchitecture) again later also!
{% endhint %}

* **Microarchitecture impact**
  * Supporting multiple instruction lengths adds complexity to the **frontend** (fetch, decode).
  * The **backend** (datapath, ALU, register file) usually remains tied to the word length, so the impact on overall hardware design is noticeable but not drastic.
* **Practical advantage: saving instruction memory**
  * Shorter instructions (16-bit vs. 32-bit) reduce code size.
  * This allows more instructions to fit into the same memory/cache, improving memory efficiency and potentially performance.
* **Word length and memory addressing**
  * In a 32-bit processor, addresses are 32 bits wide.
  * This limits the maximum directly addressable memory to $$2^{32} = 4\ \text{GB}.$$
  * This is a **backend (data memory)** property, tied to word length, not instruction length.
  * Thus, even if instructions are compressed to 16 bits, the system is still limited to 4 GB RAM because addressing depends on word length.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### More about modern processors

* **ISA Stability**
  * The **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** (e.g., x86, ARM, RISC-V) usually remains stable across generations.
  * This ensures that code compiled decades ago can still run on modern processors of the same ISA family.
  * Example: Modern Intel CPUs can still run DOS-era x86 code.
* **Extensions to the ISA**
  * Instead of replacing the ISA, new generations often **extend** it with additional instructions (e.g., Intel’s SSE, AVX, AVX-512; ARM’s NEON; RISC-V vector extensions).
  * These new instructions allow compilers and developers to take advantage of improved performance features, but are optional from the program’s perspective.
* **Backward and Forward Compatibility**
  * **Backward compatibility:** Old code (compiled for older processors) runs fine on newer processors, since the original instructions are still supported.
  * **Forward compatibility:** New code (compiled with instructions from the newest extensions) **will not run** on older processors if those instructions are missing.
  * Workaround: Compilers often provide a **compatibility mode** (e.g., “target x86-64 baseline”) so the same program can run on older hardware.
* **Real-world example: Windows 11**
  * Windows 11 requires support for certain instruction set extensions (e.g., SSE4.2, CMPXCHG16b, LAHF/SAHF, and in practice often AVX2).
  * Older CPUs without these instructions cannot run Windows 11, even though they are technically “x86-64 processors.”
* **Microarchitecture vs. ISA**
  * New processors primarily innovate by updating the **microarchitecture** (pipeline depth, branch prediction, cache design, out-of-order execution, etc.) while keeping the ISA stable.
  * This allows performance to improve without breaking software compatibility.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Registers

The register set has been introduced in [Harris & Harris](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/ddca-notes/textbook/architecture/assembly-language#the-register-set). But the following image adds the information about whether the register should be saved by the caller or callee.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-risc-v-register-set-full.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And below are some useful notes

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### ABI name and ISA name

In RISC-V assembly code, we can use ABI name, like `zero`, `ra`, etc. But in compiled code, ISA names, like `x0`, `x1`, etc, is used.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### PC in RISC-V

In RISC-V, PC is not a register readable/writable explicitly by any&#x20;instruction, e.g., it is not a visible register. And,

* In RISC-V, PC just stores the address of the current instruction. (Not like ARM, PC actually stores the address of the current instruction address +4 or +8)
* Writing PC is done **only by** branch/jump instructions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **No** instruction updates more than one visible register

This is a very important golden rule (The step title here). And, in RISC-V, the register updated is **explicitly** specified in the `rd` field. This ensures that the [register file](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/ddca-notes/textbook/digital-building-blocks/memory-arrays#register-files) only needs **one write port**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **No** instruction reads more than two registers.

Another golden rule here. This ensures that the register file needs only **2 read ports**. Below is the example of RISC-V's register file,

So, in summary, below is the illustration of RISC-V register file,

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-risc-v-register-file.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### No flag registers

In RISC-V, flags are never stored for “future use.” Instead, comparisons and branches are **self-contained**. For example, `beq x1, x2, target;` will directly compare `x1` and `x2`, and branches to `target`.

* If you _do_ need the comparison result as data, use an instruction like `slt` to store it in an **general-purpose register** `slt x3, x1, x2;` means `x3 = 1` if `x1<x2`, else `x3=0`.
* Because branch instructions already use the ALU for comparison, RISC-V usually has a separate unit to compute branch target addresses (`PC + offset`).
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Instruction Formats

RISC-V instruction has 6 formats, and they are well summarized in the following table,

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-risc-v-instruction-format.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This table is from <a href="https://github.com/jameslzhu/riscv-card">James Zhu</a> at UCB</p></figcaption></figure>

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### **Opcode field occupies the least significant part of the instruction**

This gives us the benefit that,

* CPU can recognize instruction type by just reading the first byte (since RISC-V uses [little-endian](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/cg2111a-notes/studio/studio-13-communication-protocol#big-and-little-endianness) and little-endian puts opcode at the lowest address).
* "3L mnemonic" for little-endian: In **l**ittle-endian formatting, **l**east significant byte goes to **l**owest memory address.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### `rd`, `rs1`, `rs2` **always in the same place across formats**

This makes decoder hardware is simpler (fewer multiplexers, will see later in the microarchitecture).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **All immediates are MSB-extended**

So all immediates become sign-extended words. RISC-V immediates are encoded in **2’s complement form**. So when you sign-extend, you’re effectively just preserving the correct integer value. For example, in RV32I, 12-bit immediate,

* Immediate field = `1111_1000` (0xF8).
* As 12-bit 2’s complement → −8.
* Sign-extend to 32 bits → `0xFFFFFFF8`.
* ALU sees this and just adds normally, giving a result 8 less.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only all **immediates** are MSB-extended. Later we will see, the value stored in registers sometimes are zero-extended.
{% endhint %}

However, this may become a bit wired with instruction `sltu`. But, let's look at the following example,

```riscv
sltiu x3, x1, -8
```

Suppose the above is our "set if less than immediate unsigned" instruction, and RISC-V processor will treate `-8` as `0xFFFFFFF8`.&#x20;

* `x1=-2`, `x1` will be interpreted as `0xFFFFFFFE`. As ALU just compares unsigned, `0xFFFFFFFE` is greater than `0xFFFFFFF8`, thus `false`, meaning under **unsigned comparison** `x1` is not smaller than `-8`!
* `x1=5`, `x1` will be interpreted as `0x00000101`. Similarly, ALU just compares unsigned, `0x00000101` is smaller than `0xFFFFFFF8`, thus `true`, meaning under **unsigned comparison** `x1` is **smaller** than `-8` (unsigned)

This will give us the range for the immediate in `slti` and `sltiu`: 0x800 - 0x7FF (-2048 to +2047). This range applies to all **I-type** and **S-type** instructions. The **B-type** instructionis a bit special, its range is (-4096 to +4094 <-> 0x1000 - 0xFFE). But as in B-type instructions, it is **impossible** to give the immediate manually, I think this won't appear in quizzes or finals 😂.

So, instructions like `sltiu x3, x1, 0x00000FFF` is **illegal** as `0xFFF = 4095` exceeds to range for the immediate in I-type and S-type instructions!

{% hint style="danger" %}
Treat negative number in 2's complement as **unsigned** meaning it will become a **very large positive number**.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **The location of immediate is well-designed**

From the table above, we may think why the immediate's location is that wired! Actually, later from the microarchitecture view, we will see that this is a **genius design** as it minimizes the number of multiplexers!
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### DP Instruction

"DP" stands for data-processing. The following tables summarises all the base DP instructions.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-risc-v-dp-instructions.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From this table, we notice that

* `subi` is unnecessary as the assembler can encode `A-B` as `A+(-B)`. This find as `B` is immediate, if `B` is a register, then `B` cannot be known at assembly time, and that's why `sub` is still needed.
* And the following table about the three types of shift operations is copied from [Harris & Harris](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/ddca-notes/textbook/architecture/programming#shift-instructions), just for CG3207 midterm quiz purpose.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/risc-v-shift-instrucitons-example.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### DP Pseudo-Instruction

All the pseudo-instruction in RISC-V is introduced [here](../lab/resources/risc-v-resources.md#risc-v-pseudo-instruction)! Among them, knowing the working principle of `auipc` from [Lab 1](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/ddca-notes/lab/lab-01-get-prepared#whats-actually-going-on-in-line-47-auipc) is also necessary!

<details>

<summary><code>auipc</code> explanation</summary>

In Lab1, the instruction `lw s3, delay_val` at Line 47 is actually implemented by two RISC-V instructions.&#x20;

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```riscv
auipc x19, 0x0000fc10
lw    x19, 0xffffffec(x19)
```
{% endcode %}

This is as shown as follows, (`x19` is the `s3` register)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lab01-auipc.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The reason for this two-step sequence is that **`lw`** is an I-type instruction, and I-type immediates are limited to a signed **12-bit offset** relative to a base register. This means `lw` can only directly access data within ±2048 bytes of the base address. When the data we want to load is located _far away_, we need an additional instruction to construct a base address that is “close enough.”

This is where `auipc` (Add Upper Immediate to PC) comes in. `auipc` takes the current PC value, adds a 20-bit immediate shifted left by 12 bits, and stores the result into the destination register. In other words, it lets us build a base address relative to the PC, suitable for accessing distant memory.

1. The symbol **`delay_val`** is at address `0x10010000`. The instruction `lw s3, delay_val` itself is at `0x00400014`.
   1. These two addresses differ by much more than 12 bits, so a plain `lw` cannot reach `delay_val` directly.
2. To bridge the gap, the assembler splits the target address into a **high part** and a **low part**.
   1. The **upper 20 bits** difference is: `0x10010 - 0x00400 = 0xFC10`. This becomes the immediate for `auipc`.
3. After executing `auipc x19, 0x0000fc10`, register `x19` holds: `x19 = PC + (0xFC10 << 12)`, which is a value “close” to the address of `delay_val`.
4. Now only a **small offset** is left to cover.
   1. The **lower 12 bits** difference is: `0x000 - 0x014 = 0xFFFFFFEC`. This fits within the signed 12-bit immediate range of `lw`.
5. Finally, the instruction `lw x19, 0xffffffec(x19)` uses `x19` as the base plus the small offset to reach the exact address of `delay_val` and load its value into `s3`.

***

The key idea is that `auipc` provides a way to **construct PC-relative addresses for far-away data or code**. By combining `auipc` (for the high 20 bits of the address) with an I-type instruction like `lw` (for the low 12 bits), RISC-V can access any 32-bit address in memory, despite the immediate size limitations of a single instruction.

{% hint style="success" %}
The use of `la` to load address which is far away from the current PC address works in exactly similar ways. Instead storing the content, `la` store the address of that content.
{% endhint %}

</details>

#### Multiply and Divide

The multiply and divide are not part of the base instruction set, but are available as an optional standard extension.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-risc-v-multiply-divide.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Memory Instruction

The following is the base memory instruction:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-risc-v-memory-instruction.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

So, from this table, notice that

* For the memory instruction syntax, if `imm=0`, we can omit the `imm`. e.g., `op rd, (rs1)`.
* For `lb` and `lh`, which loads a byte or a half word, the rest of bits are formed by **sign-extension/MSB-extension** (just copy the MSB) of the byte/half-word
* For `lbu` and `lhu`, **zero extension** (copy zero only) is done.

### Control Instructions

The following is the base control instructions:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-risc-v-control-instruction.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### **Jump vs. Branch**

1. `jal` can jump farther than conditional branches because
   1. `jal` instructions use 20-bit signed immediate
   2. Branch instructions use 12-bit signed immediate
2. `jal` allows for saving **return address**, while conditional branches cannot.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### The immediate in branch instructions

In the branch instructions, the immediate is 12 bits, but it stores the `[12:1]` instead of `[11:0]`. This is because in RISC-V, every instruction must start at an address that is an even number (a multiple of 2). You can never jump to an odd address (like `0x1001`) because instructions never exist there.

So, instead of storing bits `[11:0]` (which would include the useless last zero), the instruction stores bits `[12:1]`. The hardware assumes the last bit (bit 0) is always `0`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Two types of jumps**

> Look at the "Description (C)" of `jal` and `jalr` from the table above to understand this part better!

1. `jal`: jump and link, is a J-type instruction. And it stores return address in `rd`.
   1. Used when you know the **target address at assembly time**.
   2. Used in **function call** (Jump to a function’s code so it can execute)
   3. `imm` is 20-bit.
2. `jalr`: jump and link register, is an I-type instruction. And it stores return address in `rd` (usually `ra`)
   1. Use when the **target address is dynamic**, stored in a register.
   2. Used in **function return** (Go back to where the function was called from). This is because the function can be called from many different places. The return address isn't known until the program is actually running. Therefore, we jump to the address stored in the **register** `ra`.
   3. `imm` is 12-bit, but it can jump anywhere in a 32-bit absolute address range. A `lui`      \
      instruction can first load `rs1` with the upper 20 bits of a target address, then `jalr`      \
      can add in the lower bits.
      1. Similarly, `auipc` then `jalr` can jump anywhere in a 32-bit         &#x20;pc-relative address range.

For example, in the following code, we can see how `jalr` can jump to anywhere with the help of `lui`.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```riscv
# We want to jump to 0x12345678
# We split this address into two parts:
# Upper 20 bits: 0x12345
# Lower 12 bits: 0x678

# 1. Load the upper 20 bits into a temporary register (t0)
lui t0, 0x12345     
# t0 now holds: 0x12345000

# 2. Use JALR to add the lower 12 bits and jump
# Target = (Value in t0) + 0x678
# Target = 0x12345000    + 0x678 = 0x12345678
jalr ra, t0, 0x678
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Put it all together

Nothing is better than an example! So, let's loook at an example to put everything together.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="High-Level C Code" %}
{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```c
// Global variables
int z1;
int z2;

// Callee function: Computes and returns the sum of two integers
int fn2(int p, int q) {
    int temp = p + q;
    return temp;
}

// Caller function: Calls fn2 and performs additional operations
void fn1() {
    int x = 20;
    int y = 30;
    z1 = fn2(x, y); // Store result of fn2(x, y) in z1
    x++;
    y++;
    z2 = x + y; // Store x + y in z2
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="RISC-V Assembly Code" %}
{% code lineNumbers="true" %}

#### Code Explanation

## RISC-V Microarchitecture

From a computer hardware engineer's view, a computer can be divided into 2 parts

* [Datapath](lec-03-risc-v-isa-and-microarchitecture.md#datapath): Backend
* [Control Unit](lec-03-risc-v-isa-and-microarchitecture.md#control-unit): Frontend

### Datapath

Datapath is the path through which data "flows". It includes the following elements

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### **Storage elements**

Like memories and registers. The storage elements can be further divided into the following parts

1. **Architectural state elements**: manipulated by the programmer, like instruction memory (IROM), data memory (DMEM), register file (x0-x31), PC, and other control registers.
2. **Microarchitectural state elements**: **not accessible** to the   &#x20;programmers, like pipeline registers, cache tags, and branch predictor state.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Steering logic**

This is to **channel** data properly. For example, in the pipeline, should the ALU take operand from register file, or from immediate, or from forwarding path?

The steering logic is implemented using

* **multiplexers** (select one of many inputs) and
* **internal buses** (shared connections).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Functional units**

These units **operate** on data, like deciding **where the data should go**. For example,

* **ALU**: performs add, subtract, AND, OR, shifts, etc.
* **Adders**: sometimes separate for PC update, address calculation, etc.
  * Often **stateless** because they don’t store, just compute outputs when inputs arrive.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Interface resources**

These connect the CPU to the **outside world**. For example,

* **External buses**: connect CPU to memory, I/O devices, GPU, etc.
* **Ports**: I/O interfaces like memory-mapped registers, communication ports.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

<details>

<summary>What is bus?</summary>

From the above points, we may wonder what on earth is a bus? From Wikipedia, the definition is

> In computer architecture, a **bus** is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers. At its core, a bus is a **shared physical pathway**, typically composed of wires, that allows multiple devices to communicate.

And, bus in computer architecture can be categorized based on the following two categories

#### The **location** of the bus

1. **Internal buses**: inside the CPU datapath.
   1. Example: register file → ALU operand buses.
2. **External buses**: connects CPU to **outside world** (main memory, I/O devices, GPU, etc.).
   1. Example: system bus, PCIe, AMBA, memory bus.

#### The **purpose** of the bus

This is basically what the information a bus can carry

1. **Data bus**: carries the actual _data values_ being read or written.
2. **Address bus**: carries the _location_ of data (memory address or register index).
3. **Control bus**: carries _signals_ that say _what operation is happening_.

***

Usually, we use the **location** of the bus first, then say the **purpose** of the bus.

### Control Unit

Control Unit **controls** the flow/processing/storage of data in&#x20;the datapath via

* **Mux selects**: choose which input goes into a multiplexer (e.g., should ALU input B come from register or immediate?).
* **Register write enables**: should this register latch a new value at the clock edge or stay the same?
* **Functional unit activation**: is the ALU active? Is the memory doing a read or a write?
* **Operation selection**: what exact operation should ALU perform (add, sub, AND, OR…)?

{% hint style="success" %}
The Control Unit in the CISC processor uses **state machine** while the one in the strictly single cycle processor uses **combinational logic**.

### Implement a single-cycle microarchitecture

In this lecture, we will implement a single-cycle microarchitecture first. So basically, a single-cycle microarchitecture will fetch, decode, execute all in **one clock cycle**. And in this lecture, we have covered four single-cycle microarchitectures, each is built upon the previous one,

#### Single-Cycle Processor with Control

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-single-cycle-processor-control.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As in a single-cycled processor, the CU is just a decoder, the following table summarises the decoder behavior,

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-cu-decoder-logic.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you can save from the schematic above, the ALU will also output a 3-bit ALUFlags to the PC Logic, inside the Control Unit, and the PC logic is summarised as follows,

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-pc-logic.png" alt="" width="467"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Inside the PC logic, we should be aware that it has two **inputs** (`PCS`, `ALUFlags[2:0]`) and one **output** (`PCSrc`)

* `PCS`: determines the **instruction category** for PC updates.
* `ALUFlags[2:0]`: Bits that describe the outcome of the ALU operation. The three bits are `{eq, lt, ltu}`.
* `PCSrc`: 1-bit control signal to choose the next PC Value.
  * `0`: use the **default PC+4** (fallthrough to next instruction).
  * `1`: use the **branch/jump target** (computed by ALU + immediate).

For now, our PC only supports the `beq`, it will support more in the following iteration.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### PC Logic with all conditions

The schematic is the same as the above. But, the PC logic is complete, we will look at `funct3` field in the instruction to decide which branch instruction is being chosen.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-pc-logic-complete-branch.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Support for `lui` and `auipc`

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-support-for-lui-auipc.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here, we just add a 2-bit output named `ALUSrcA` from our decoder, these 2 bits will control whether the ALU SrcA will have the current `PC` as input. And regarding this, we have CU decoder table updated as follows,

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-lui-auipc-cu-logic.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
It is clear that we can see from DP Reg to branch instruction, the ALUSrcA is just `x0`, which means the first bit is Don't Care and the second bit is 0.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Support for link and `jalr`

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-support-for-link-jalr.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here, we have two modifications:

1. change the `ALUSrcB` from 1-bit to 2-bit, thus adding another possibility for the immediate 4 to be the input of ALU SrcB.
2. change the `PCSrc` from 1-bit to 2-bit, thus adding another possibility for the PC value to be read from Register File `RD1`.

Thus, we have two changes for our tables, the first one is the CU decoder table

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-link-jalr-cu-logic.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
Here, we can clearly see that when our instruction is `jal`, the `ALUSrcA=11` makes sure the ALU SrcA is the current PC value. And `ALUSrcB=01` makes sure that the ALU SrcB is immediate 4. Then the ALU will add these two and store the result into `rd`.
{% endhint %}

And our PC Logic table will also change,

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cg3207-lec03-pc-logic-jalr.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
Again, we can see it clearly that when the instruction is `jalr`, `PCSrc[1]=1`, and this will load the value in `rs1` into the PC adder, and `PCSrc[0]=1` will load the immediate value into the PC adder. And now the new PC value will be the sum of these two values! (As `jalr rd, imm(rs1)` -> `rd=PC+4, PC=rs1+imm`.)
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

This is the whole content to build a simple single-cycle RISC-V processor. And we may notice the following,

* No datapath resource can be used more than once per instruction, so some must be duplicate
  * **Separate memories**: because fetch and load/store both need memory at the same time.
  * **Two adders**: because PC+4 and normal ALU addition both need addition in the same cycle.

> So, how can we make it faster? The answer is wait for Lec 05 😉!
