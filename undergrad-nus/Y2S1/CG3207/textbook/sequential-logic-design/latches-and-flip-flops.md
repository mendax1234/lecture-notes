# Latches and Flip-Flops

## Bistable Element

The fundamental building block of memory is a _bistable_ element, an element with two stable states. Figure 3.1 (a) shows a simple bistable element consisting of a pair of inverters connected in a loop. Figure 3.1 (b) shows the same circuit redrawn to emphasize the symmetry.

The inverters are _cross-coupled_, meaning that the input of I1 is the output of I2 and vice versa. The circuit has no inputs, but it does have two outputs, $$Q$$ and $$\bar Q$$.

Analyzing this circuit is different from analyzing a combinational circuit because it is cyclic: $$Q$$ depends on $$\bar Q$$ and $$\bar Q$$ depends on $$Q$$. So, we just need to consider two cases: $$Q$$ is 0 or $$Q$$ is 1.

And we may find out that this circuit is **stable** under these two cases (By saying the circuit is stable, we mean that under each of the two cases above, $$Q$$ and $$\bar Q$$ don't conflict). Thus, we can say this cross-coupled inverter has two **stable** states, and because of this, it is **bistable**.

#### Notes

1. An element with N stable states conveys $$\log_2N$$ bits of information, so a **bistable** element stores one bit.
2. The state of the cross-coupled inverters is contained in one binary state variable, $$Q$$. The value of $$Q$$ tells us everything about the past that is necessary to explain the future behavior of the circuit. Specifically, if $$Q$$ = 0, it will remain 0 forever, and if $$Q$$ = 1, it will remain 1 forever.
3. The circuit does have another node, $$\bar Q$$, but $$\bar Q$$ does not contain any additional information because if $$Q$$ is known, $$\bar Q$$ is also known. On the other hand, $$\bar Q$$ is also an acceptable choice for the state variable.
4. When power is first applied to a sequential circuit, the initial state is unknown and usually unpredictable. It may differ each time the circuit is turned on.
{% endhint %}

Although the cross-coupled inverters can store a bit of information, they are not practical because the user has no inputs to control the state. However, other bistable elements, such as _latches_ and _flip-flops_, provide inputs to control the value of the state variable. The remainder of this section considers these circuits.

## SR Latch

One of the simplest sequential circuits is the SR _Latch_, which is composed of two cross-coupled NOR gates, as shown in Figure 3.3. The latch has two inputs, S and R, and two outputs $$Q$$ and $$\bar Q$$. The SR latch is similar to the cross-coupled inverters, but its state (the value of $$Q$$ ) can be controlled through the S and R inputs, which _set_ and _reset_ the output $$Q$$.

To analyze this circuit, we can build a truth table by considering the four cases of two inputs S and R. And we will build a truth table as shown in Figure 3.5 below

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/sr-latch-truth-table.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that in Case IV, when S and R are both 0, there are only two subcases which the current $$Q$$ can be either 0 or 1. Thus, we find that the future $$Q$$ will still remain the same.
{% endhint %}

The SR latch is represented by the symbol in Figure 3.6. Using the symbol is an application of **abstraction** and **modularity**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/sr-latch-symbol.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Like the cross-coupled inverters, the SR latch is a bistable element with one bit of state stored in $$Q$$. Notice that the entire history of inputs can be accounted for by the single state variable $$Q$$.

## D Latch

The SR Latch is awkward because it behaves strangely when both S and R are simultaneously asserted. Moreover, the S and R inputs **conflate** the issues of _what_ and _when_. And designing circuits becomes easier when these questions of what and when are **separated**. The D latch in Figure 3.7 (a) solves these problems. It has two inputs:

1. The _data_ input, D, controls what the next state should be.
2. The _clock_ input, CLK, controls when the state should change.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/D-latch.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By analyzing this circuit, we see that the clock controls when data flows through the latch. When CLK = 1, the latch is _transparent_. The data at D flows through to Q as if the latch were just a **buffer** (from the point of comparing output Q and input D). When CLK = 0, the latch is _opaque_. It blocks the new data from flowing through to Q, and Q retains the old value. Hence, the D latch is sometimes called a _transparent latch_ or _level-sensitive_ latch. The D latch symbol is given in Figure 3.7 (c).

In the D latch, from the truth table, we can clearly see that its state variable is still $$Q$$. And the D latch is actually built upon the SR latch!

{% hint style="info" %}
We may notice that the D latch updates its state **continuously** while CLK = 1. We shall see later in this chapter that it is useful to update the state only at a specific instant in time.
{% endhint %}

#### Types of Latches

The latches can be classified into two types:

1. **Transparent High**:
   1. When CLK is HIGH (`1`): The latch is Transparent. The output Q follows the input D immediately (changes in D are seen at Q).
   2. When CLK is LOW (`0`): The latch is Opaque (Latched). The output Q freezes and holds the last value it had right before the clock went low.
2. **Transparent Low**:
   1. When CLK is LOW (`0`): The latch is Transparent. The output Q follows the input D immediately.
   2. When CLK is HIGH (`1`): The latch is Opaque (Latched). The output freezes.

## D Flip-Flop

A D _flip-flop_ can be built from two back-to-back D latches controlled by complementary clocks, as shown in Figure 3.8 (a). The first latch, L1, is called the _master_. The second latch, L2, is called the _slave_. The node between them is named N1. A symbol for the D flip-flop is given in Figure 3.8 (b). When the $$\bar Q$$ output is not needed, the symbol is often condensed as in Figure 3.8 (c).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/d-flip-flop.png" alt="" width="223"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To analyze the behavior of a D flip-flop, we can see the following example (ignoring the delay between the gates 😂),

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/d-flip-flop-explanation.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To put it simply, a D flip-flop _**copies D to Q on the rising edge of the clock, and remembers its state at all other times until the next rising edge comes, then it will update its state**_**.**

{% hint style="danger" %}
The sentence above is very very important! And beginner digital designer must remember it!
{% endhint %}

The rising edge of the clock is often just called the _clock edge_ for brevity. The D input specifies what the new state will be. The clock edge indicates when the state should be updated.

A D flip-flop is also known as a _master-slave flip-flop_, an _edge-triggered flip-flop_, or a _positive edge-triggered flip-flop_. The triangle in the symbols denotes an edge-triggered clock input. The $$\bar Q$$ is often omitted when it is not needed.

{% hint style="success" %}
The term flip-flop or latch by itself usually refers to a **D flip-flop** or a **D latch**, respectively, because these are the types most commonly used in practice. We will use this convention through this book.
{% endhint %}

### Enabled Flip-Flop

An _enabled flip-flop_ adds another input called EN or ENABLE to determine whether data is loaded on the clock edge. When EN is TRUE, the enabled flip-flop behaves like an ordinary D flip-flop. When EN is FALSE, the enabled flip-flop ignores the clock and retains its state.

{% hint style="success" %}
Enabled flip-flops are useful when we wish to load a new value into a flip-flop only some of the time, rather than on every clock edge.
{% endhint %}

Figure 3.10 shows two ways to construct an enabled flip-flop from a D flip-flop and an extra logic.

* In Figure 3.10 (a), a **multiplexer** chooses whether to pass the value at D , if EN is TRUE, or to recycle the old state from Q, if EN is FALSE. (The EN here acts as the select line for the multiplexer).
* In Figure 3.10 (b), the clock is _gated_ (with an AND gate), this is not recommended because the gate can delay the clock and cause timing errors!

The symbol for an enabled flip-flop is given in Figure 3.10(c).

### Resettable Flip-Flop

A _resettable flip-flop_ adds another input called RESET. When RESET is FALSE, the resettable flip-flop behaves like an ordinary D flip-flop. When RESET is TRUE, the resettable flip-flop ignores D and resets the output to 0.

{% hint style="success" %}
Resettable flip-flops are useful when we want to force a known state (i.e., 0) into all the flip-flops in a system when we first turn it on.
{% endhint %}

Such resettable flip-flops maybe _synchronously_ or _asynchronously resettable_.

* Synchronously resettable flip-flops reset themselves only on the rising edge of CLK.
* Asynchronously resettable flip-flops reset themselves as soon as RESET becomes TRUE, independent of CLK.

Figure 3.11 (a) shows how to construct a synchronously resettable flip-flop with **active low reset** from an ordinary D flip-flop and an AND gate. Figures 3.11 (b) and 3.11 (c) show symbols for the resettable flip-flop with **active high reset**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/resettable-flip-flop.png" alt="" width="266"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Asynchronous resettable flip-flops require modifying the internal structure of the flip-flop. Both synchronously and asynchronously resettable flip-flops are frequently available to the designer as standard components.

### Settable Flip-Flop

As you might imagine, settable flip-flops are also occasionally used. They load a 1 into the flip-flop when SET is asserted and they, too, come in synchronous and asynchronous flavors. The symbols for settable flip-flops are just changing the "r" to "s" at the bottom of the rectangle.

{% hint style="success" %}
Resettable and settable flip-flops may also have an enable input and may be grouped into N-bit registers.
{% endhint %}

## Register

An N-bit register is a bank of N flip-flops (referring to D flip-flops) that share a common CLK input, so that all bits of the register are updated at the same time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Registers are the key building block of most sequential circuits.
{% endhint %}

Figure 3.9 shows the schematic and symbol for a four-bit register with inputs $$D_{3:0}$$ and outputs $$Q_{3:0}$$. $$D_{3:0}$$ and $$Q_{3:0}$$ are both 4-bit buses.

## Putting it all together

Latches and flip-flops are the fundamental building blocks of sequential circuits. Remember that:

1. A D latch is **level sensitive**, which means when the CLK is 1, the D latch will copy the input D to the output Q **continuously**.
2. A D flip-flop is **edge-triggered**, which specifically means the D flip-flop copies D to Q **once** on the **rising edge** of CLK.

For latches and flip-flops, besides the above two times, at all other times, latches and flip-flops retain their old state.

A register is a bank of several D flip-flops that share a common CLK signal.
