Welcome to **The Core Dump**. This site functions as a non-volatile memory snapshot of my academic journey. It serves as a central directory, mapping course codes (Virtual Addresses) to their respective study materials (Physical Addresses).

## Memory Map

The repository is segmented by execution stage:

* **[Year 1]**: Foundations (CS1010, Calculus, Physics).
* **[Year 2]**: Core Architecture (Digital Logic, Computer Org, OOP).
* **[Year 3 & 4]**: Advanced Systems & Specializations.
* **[Self-Study]**: Side-loaded kernels (Rust, Web Dev).

## Architecture

This documentation is built on a hybrid stack to ensure precision:

| Data Type | Format | Hosted On |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Course Reviews** | Markdown | Here (MkDocs) |
| **Technical Notes** | Markdown | [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) |
| **Math/Physics** | LaTeX (`.tex`) | [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) / PDF |

!!! tip "Navigation"
    Use the **Tabs** above to switch years, or the **Search Bar** (hotkey: `s`) to query specific modules.
