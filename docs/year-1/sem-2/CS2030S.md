# CS2030S Course Review

## Introduction

- **Full name**: [CS2030S Programming Methodology II](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2030S/programming-methodology-ii)
- **Target audience**: NUS Year 1 SoC Students
- **Purpose of the course**: To introduce the basic but important concepts of Java, OOP and functional programming and bridge the gap between CS1010 equivalent and CS2103 equivalent.
- **Notes Structure**: View the [CS2030S Lecture Notes](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/cs2030s-notes/)
    1. [**CS2030S-Cheatsheet**](https://github.com/mendax1234/lecture-notes/tree/main/Y1S2/CS2030S/CS2030S-Cheatsheet): Here, you'll find the cheatsheet I created and used in the PEs, midterms and finals, summarizing key concepts and methods for quick reference.

I took this course in AY24/25 Sem 2 as an elective because I wanted to experience the awesome course at NUS SoC and follow up Prof. Wei Tsang's teaching after CS1010.

## Course Content

### Overview of Topics Covered

1. **Object-Oriented Programming**
    - Compiler Types, Classes, and Objects
    - Class, Instance / Methods, Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Exception and Wrapper Classes
    - Generics
    - Wildcards
    - Immutability and Nested Classes
2. **Functional Programming**
    - Basics of Functional Programming
    - Infinite Lists and Streams
    - Monad and Parallel Stream
    - Parallelization and Asynchronous

### Depth and Balance of Coverage

#### Theoretical Understanding

As a CS course that must be taken by every CS student, I can clearly see that there is a lot of theory (math-related) stuff in CS2030S, making it a not that easy course for a CEG student who has no functional programming background. However, now looking back, I was amazed at how certain stuff is actually used in the real software-engineering world, like streams, etc.

This course not only lays a foundation for using Java as my main programming language for coding, but also successfully serves its purpose well, which is to help me feel easier in my software engineering course (CS2113).

#### Application and real-world examples

I strongly believe that after taking this course, you will be well equipped with all the basic knowledge about Java, this will lay a solid foundation for you so that you can focus purely on the algorithm's side in your CS2040S.

Programming language is just a tool, but I would say Java is not a bad choice if you just want to pass the technical interviews in the future. And regarding the functional programming, those fancy ideas like lambda, streams, are legit used in the real-world software engineering project written in Java.

#### Challenging or Unique Aspects

1. **The hard theory**
    As I have mentioned above, the theory in CS2030S successfully the good tradition from every CS course, which is having a lot of maths stuff. I acknowledge that this will increase the difficulty of the overal course. However, to be honest, sometimes using some basic maths knowledge to understand some parts will make your life easier. One good example is to use **subset** in maths to understand the **subtype relationship**.
2. **Practical Practice**
    The practice and theory is usually a trade-off. As this course focuses more on the theory, I would say the practice on the real coding become less, making it hard to score perfectly during the Practical Exams (PE). But I would say, the real time to practice all the theory will be in CS2103 or equivalent.

## Teaching Style and Materials

### Teaching Style

#### Lectures

The lectures are conducted by Prof. Boyd in the first half of the semester and Prof. Ashish in the second half. Both professors can explain clearly. But one disadvantage is that all the lectures are conducted **online**, making me feel that the lectures are not as impressing as CS1010's lectures.

#### Tutorials

My original tutor is Dr. Tan Yugin, but I just switched to Dr. Enzio's starting from the second tutorial (IYKYK :joy:). Enzio is very passionate about the class and can always explain the concepts very clearly and well. His class is also very interactive! Like his tutorial!

#### Labs

My initial plan is to join my CS1010 tutor's Lab (Mr. Zhang Puyu), but as I cannot secure his slot, so I joined two labs in one week. My tutors are Mr. Zhang Puyu and Mr. Quek Yew Wei. For Puyu, I don't need to add any more stuff, he is the G.O.A.T! For Yew Wei, he is very kind and will respond to my questions very fast!

#### Assessments

1. **Take-Home Exercises**: These are ungraded and is done using technically the same environment as CS1010 (Vim), the exercises are not trivial and the exercises regarding the functional programming will be quite **important** for the PE2.
2. **Practical Exams (PE)**: CS2030S's PEs are not as worse as CS1010's PE. In my cohort, it is quite doable to score nearly full marks for both graded PEs (PE1 and PE2). For PE1, practice the pyp and get familiar with the typing (I heard quite a few people didn't finish the PE1, which is quite sad.) For PE2, it is quite doable and most of the people I know score nearly full marks.

### Course Book

**Textbook**: There is no specific textbook for CS2030S, I would say the most useful resources I have used in this course is the [official Java document](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/).

## Learning Experience

### Personal Insights

As the unrestricted elective I took out of my impressive impression from CS1010, to be honest, this course didn't really reach my expectation (That is not said this course is not good. It is, but maybe due to several reasons, I would still say CS1010 is the best SoC courses I have taken).

However, I would say this experience to study and compete with the most talent people (the whoe CS cohort at NUS) is a quite unique and meaningful experience to me. I start to experiencing the meaning of "Grade is not everything, focus on learning new things, leveling-up your skills and enriching your experience" from CS1010. It is sometimes really hard to push yourself to the perfect, especially when you are studying with a group of talents. In this situation, I would say that just focus on the skills that you are going to acquire during this journey, this will make life less stressful.

### Skills Developed

This course has taught me the basics of Java, and how to use Java to program in an object-oriented way and functional way. This will definitely prepare me for my future courses on using Java to solve LeetCode problems and my experience in the software engineering field.

## Workload and Time Management

- **Level of Difficulty**: 8/10
- **Tips for future cohort**: I hope my compiled lectures notes can help ease your burden during this course!

## Conclusion

This is might not be easy, but it will be eye-opening if you want to be a software guy!
