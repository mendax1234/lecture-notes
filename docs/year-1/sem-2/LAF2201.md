## Introduction

- **Full name**: [LAF2201 French 2](https://nusmods.com/courses/LAF2201/french-2)

- **Notes Structure**: View the [LAF2201 Lecture Notes](https://github.com/mendax1234/lecture-notes/tree/main/Y1S2/LAF2201)
    1. **LAF1201-Notes**: The file `LAF2201_Notes` contains the notes (mainly vocabulary and grammar) when I study this course.

I took this course in AY24/25 Semester 2 as part of my preparation for the [NUS French Double Degree Programme (FDDP)](https://fddp.nus.edu.sg/).

## Course Content

### Overview of Topics Covered

French 2 continues directly from French 1 and completes the remaining four units from the same textbook:

1. **Unit 5: C'est arrivé quand ?**
2. **Unit 6: Alors, ton nouveau travail ?**
3. **Unit 7: Pourquoi déménager ?**
4. **Unit 8: Il y a un problème ?**

### Depth and Balance of Coverage

This course marks the completion of the DELF A1 level. From what I remember, the only major new grammar point introduced is the *passé composé* (past tense). Apart from that, the course mainly emphasizes:

- Expansion of vocabulary
- Reinforcement of sentence structures
- Practice of common expressions built upon French 1

In other words, French 2 is less about learning entirely new grammatical systems and more about strengthening fluency and practical usage.

## Teaching Style and Materials

#### Tutorial

Mon professeur est Monsieur Nour Eddine Larhzal. Il est très gentil, et il prononce le français très clairement. Il peut aussi nous expliquer les points de grammaire de manière claire et détaillée. C'est vraiment génial !

## Learning Experience

To be honest, since I did not join the immersion programme in France, I found French 2 more challenging than expected. However, by paying closer attention to grammar, especially the passé composé, I found that the written exams were manageable.

The oral exam, on the other hand, was still quite challenging for me at that time. Speaking in real-time under pressure, especially in a foreign language, is always a different level of difficulty compared to written practice.

Still, this challenge also made me clearly realize where my weaknesses were, which helped me adjust my learning strategy afterward. which is to focus more on listening and speaking practice.

## Workload and Time Management

- **Level of Difficulty**: **5/10**
- **Tips for Future Students**: Same advice as for French 1 — the mémo at the end of each unit in the textbook is extremely useful for revision and consolidation. If you master what's inside those summaries, you are already in very good shape for the exams.

## Conclusion

LAF2201 is a well-structured and straightforward continuation of French 1. While it may not be extremely intense, it plays a crucial role in solidifying your foundation in French, especially in past tense usage and daily communication.

More personally, this was also the last course I took together with my Year 4 friends Zeen and Glen, which makes it a very memorable one for me. For that reason alone, this course will always stay in my memory.
