# CG2111A Course Review

## Introduction

- **Full name**: [CG2111A Engineering Principles and Practice II](https://nusmods.com/courses/CG2111A/engineering-principles-and-practice-ii)
- **Target audience**: NUS Year 1 Computer Engineering Students
- **Purpose of the course**: To introduce the basics of microcontroller programming on ATmega328P and mostly importantly, with an interesting project.
- **Notes Structure**: View the [CG2111A Lecture Notes](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/cg2111a-notes)
    1. [**CG2111-Cheatsheet**](https://github.com/mendax1234/lecture-notes/tree/main/Y1S2/CG2111A/CG2111A-Cheatsheet): Here, you'll find the cheatsheet I created and used throughout the course, summarizing key concepts and methods for quick reference.

I took this course in AY24/25 Sem 2 for my degree requirement.

## Course Content

### Overview of Topics Covered

1. **Studio 1**: GPIO Programming
2. **Studio 2**: Interrupts
3. **Studio 4**: PWM Programming
4. **Studio 5**: Timers
5. **Studio 6**: ADC Module
6. **Studio 9**: Serial Communication
7. **Studio 10**: LiDAR Programming
8. **Studio 13**: Communication Protocol
9. **Studio 15**: Secure Networking

### Depth and Balance of Coverage

#### Theoretical Understanding

Comparing to EPP1, I think EPP2 becomes more **hands-on**, where pure theory becomes less. That is not to say that there is no theory. From the perspective of a Year 2 student, I would say some concepts that were introduced in EPP2 are quite useful, like the **interrupts**. Besides, the last two studio's topics are quite challenging, but they will only appear in the Quiz 2 so you won't need to know them for the final project.

#### Application and real-world examples

As usual, EPP2 is known for its final project. This time, I heard from my friends that it was very stressful to finish this project on time. But thankfully, my group is working pretty efficiently :smile:. However, from my personal point of view, this time the project doesn't have too much that is related to the theory that I have learned in the studios. For the final project, the main idea is to make our robot move smoothly and implement a "fast" SLAM by using the processing power on the PC instead of the RPi.

#### Challenging or Unique Aspects

I think the most challenging part is about the last two studios, which are **Communication Protocol** and **Secure Networking**. However, they are not that important in the final project.

## Teaching Style and Materials

### Teaching Style

#### Lab/Studio/Tutorial

I feel so grateful that my labs are taught by Mr. Khoa again! Feel so lucky to be his student in both EPP1 and EPP2 :smile:! He is such a passionate teacher and I still remember the time asking him questions after the lab ends with another student! However, regarding the content of the studios, I feel that they are not as well structured as EPP1. This might be because we all know that Prof. Colin (the course coordinator) likes to change stuff.

#### Quiz

The two quizzes are relatively easy for my batch and some "accidents" like the Quiz 1 in EPP1 literally reuses the past year paper doesn't exist in EPP2. Basically, if you can understand each concept in the studio as well as in the tutorial, the quiz will not be that hard.

#### Final Project

As I have mentioned a bit above, the final project will be hard if you are unlucky to carry your whole group. Besides the programming part, this year the teaching team also requires us to design a "grabber" to grab the astronaut. This is quite engineering and will give you the change to use the skills you have learned in EG1311! At least, I have successfully reused the **rubber bang** thinking on my EPP2 bot also!

Mainly the three important points help you succeed in this project are:

1. **Make your robot move smoothly**: Consider using "WASD" to control your robot. You might also want to implement different speed modes also.
2. **Make your SLAM fast**: Do not run SLAM on RPi, think about how to run it on your PC instead. Based on my group;s experience, running SLAM on PC is a **huge** improvement.
3. **Have/Train a solid driver**: Believe me, no matter how good your code is, if you don't have a good driver, your robot will not perform well.

### Course Book

**Textbook**: There is no specific textbook (from Prof Colin's original response). For this course, I would say the studio materials after revision are already good enough. And the [ATmega328P datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf) is legit an awesome reference!

## Leraning Experience

### Personal Insights

Feel very lucky to work with my one of my groups members from EPP1 and two others newly met but awesome members! Thankfully, Mr. Khoa is still teaching me in EPP2! And all the TAs, including, Edward, Benjamin, etc are super helpful also!

### Skills Developed

The most important skill I have learned is about **how to read the documentation**. I still remember the time I was impressed by the ARM documentation in NTU SC1006. This time, the ATmega328P datasheet is also very clear! As I would say reading the documentation is a very important skill for Computer Engineering students to build the gap between the theory that they learned at NUS and the real-world industry projects.

## Workload Time management

- **Level of Difficulty**: 7/10
- **Tips for future cohort**:
    I hope my notes and our group's final project code will help you focus on learning the concepts instead of just trying to rush finishing this course!

## Conclusion

Overall, this module is not that hard and time consuming!
