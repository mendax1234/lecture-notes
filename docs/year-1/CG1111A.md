# CG1111A Course Review

## Introduction

- **Full name**: [CG1111A Engineering Principles and Practice I](https://nusmods.com/courses/CG1111A/engineering-principles-and-practice-i)
- **Target audience**: NUS Year 1 Computer Engineering Students
- **Purpose of the course**: They are first taught the fundamental principles of electronic circuits through experiential learning, along which they also build up their hands-on circuit designing, building, and debugging skills. They are then guided to apply these principles and skills to build a sensor-assisted autonomous robotic vehicle as a grand finale challenge.

### Depth and Balance of Coverage

- **Theoretical Understanding**:  
    As a CEG student, the introductory course in Electrical Engineering has truly exceeded my expectations! We began with the fundamentals of circuit analysis theorems and progressed to exploring significant real-world applications, such as operational amplifiers. It’s exciting and challenging! However, likely due to time constraints, the course cannot delve into every theoretical detail. Therefore, self-study remains an essential part of mastering the material.

- **Application and real-world examples**:  
    This is hands-down one of the most thrilling parts of the course! You can *feel* the power of knowledge coming alive through the quizzes and the final project. This is what engineering is all about -- taking the theories you've learned and transforming them into real-world applications. It’s electrifying, it’s impactful, and it’s pure awesomeness!

- **Challenging or Unique Aspects**:  
    In this course, I’ll admit the most challenging parts for me were the op-amps and op-amp comparators. But thanks to the brilliant explanations from my amazing Prof Khoa, and the dedicated TAs, I feel like I’ve grasped the concepts! That said, if you dive deeper into the material through the textbook, the real challenge may shift toward understanding the underlying signals and the complex mathematics involved.

## Teaching Style and Materials

- **Lab**:
    The lab sessions were undoubtedly the heart of this course. I feel incredibly lucky to have been taught by Prof. Nguyen Tien Khoa, who is not only extremely knowledgeable but also unbelievably kind. I will never forget how patiently he explained every one of my questions, making even the most complex concepts clear. And how can I not mention his heartfelt gesture of treating everyone to bubble tea during our last lab? That warmth and thoughtfulness legit left a lasting impression on me.  

    The three TAs were equally amazing -- always kind, approachable, and ready to help whenever I had questions during experiments. Their support made the learning experience so much smoother and more enjoyable.  

    And of course, my classmates! Even though we’re all guys, I felt such a genuine sense of camaraderie and support throughout this journey. It’s been an unforgettable experience sharing this class with yall.  

    This is what makes NUS CEG so special -- a community that’s not just about learning but about growing together. I’m so grateful to be part of it. Let’s keep going forward together! LFG!!!

- **Quiz**:  
    The quizzes were fantastic! I could feel the excitement as I applied the theory I have learned to real-world problems. Huge thanks to the CG1111A Teaching Team for crafting such engaging and rewarding challenges!

- **Final Project**:  
    The final project was the ultimate highlight of this course. Building the "a-maze-ing race" robot not only deepened our understanding of theoretical concepts but also let us experience the true beauty of engineering design firsthand!

### Course Book

**Textbook**: The textbook we use for this course is *Electrical Engineering: Principles and Applications* by Allen R. Hambley. This is a very famous introductory textbook for Electrical Engineering. I feel that I have learned a lot after reading this book! Strongly recommended to read!

## Learning Experience

My journey in this course has been nothing short of extraordinary. I didn’t just gain foundational knowledge in Electrical Engineering -- I felt the incredible warmth of everyone around me. From the unwavering support of my Prof and TAs to the camaraderie of my classmates, every moment has been inspiring and unforgettable. I’m deeply moved by the knowledge, the people, and the passion that brought us all together. Thank you all for making this experience so meaningful! LFG!

## Work Load and Time management

- **Level of Difficulty**: **6/10**
- **Tips for future cohort**:  
    I hope my notes will ease your workload and provide clarity on the concepts covered in this course. They are designed to help you grasp the material more effectively and approach the challenges with confidence.

## Conclusion

This is the one of the best and warmest courses I have taken in NUS till now! Love it so much!
