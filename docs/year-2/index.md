# Year 2

Starting from year 2, I feel that I start focusing more on my major-related courses, specifically Digital Electronics. While taking courses at NUS and looking at the real-world projects, I feel a huge gap in between. However, during my processing of filling this gap, I have made some notes for myself as well as for future students as reference!
