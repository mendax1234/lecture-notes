# CG2027 Course Review

## Introduction

- **Full name**: [CG2027 Transistor-level Digital Circuits](https://nusmods.com/courses/CG2027/transistor-level-digital-circuits)
- **Target audience**: NUS Year 2 CEG Students
- **Purpose of the course**: To provide students with a brief introduction to MOSFETs and how CMOS transistors are used to build digital logic gates and some high-level functional units. The power and timing analysis of CMOS circuits are also covered in this course.
- **Notes Content**: View the [CG2027 Lecture Notes](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/cg2027-notes/)

## Course Content

### Overview of Topics Covered

1. **The Device**: Know the underlying working principles and I-V characteristics of NMOS and PMOS.
2. **CMOS Inverter**: Use CMOS transistors to build inverters and analyze the propagation delay and power consumption of CMOS circuits.
3. **CMOS Logic**: Use CMOS transistors to build relatively more complex circuits than inverters. Pass transistors and transmission gates.
4. **ALU**: Analyze the performance of different kinds of adders: Ripple-Carray Adders, Carry Bypass Adder, Linear/Square Carry Select.
5. **Memory**: Know the underlying working principle of DRAM, SRAM, NAND Flash. How is data being written and read into these memory.

### Depth and Balance of Coverage

#### Theoretical Understanding

This is another hardcore course for CEG/EE students, and it covers 3 abstraction levels mentioned in Harris & Harris DDCA, from physics, devices and finally to digital cicuits. The concepts about the PN junctions, the MOSFETs, and how they are used to build the digital cirucits are very very important for those who wants to pursue your study in digital/analog circuit design.

#### Application and real-world examples

CMOS Transistors are the fundamental building block of nowaday's chips. Knowing how the transistor works legit lets me experience the elegance of the invention of transistors. Besides, using the first principle rule, we can only optimize certain technologies only after when know how its predecessors work! However, as a 2k level module, this course focuses more on knowing what's going on instead of the more theory-heavy side, which also means there is still a huge gap between the knowledge we have learned and the real digital ciruit we are going to build using Cadence/Synopsys.

#### Challenging or Unique Aspects

1. **The timing analysis for Different Adders**: Trying to understand deeper about where the propagation comes from first. After knowing this, then study the data will go through which combinational parts. And lastly, find the longest path and that is your maximum propagation delay / critical path.
2. **CMOS Transistor in Memory**: If you want to know how exactly each type of memory is built from CMOS transistors and how they work to read and store the data, going to merely to the lecture may not be enough. Thus, I will strongly suggest searching for some videos online to give you a vivid understanding! (These resources are included in my notes!)

## Teaching Style and Materials

### Teaching Style

#### Lecture

This year, the lecture is conducted by Prof. Annie Kumar. I heard last sem (AY24/25 Sem 2)'s prof is not that satisfactory. I would this, Prof. Annie is very kind and very willing to help solve any of the question that students have. However, I am still feeling very sad that the big name for analog cirucits in NUS ECE (Prof. Jerald Yoo) has left. When reading through the slides, I can really feel that Prof. Jerald's excellence in this field. And I cannot imagine how excellent and impressive the lectures will be if they are conducted by Prof. Jerald Yoo.

#### Tutorials

My tutor is Mr. Juezhao Yu. He is very knowledgeable and very kind as well! Recommend to take his tutorial, if the other option is not Prof. Kelvin or Prof. Jerald. I still can remember one time Mr. Juezhao uses an example of how one drop of ink dissipates in the water to explain the dissipation that happens between the electrons in the CMOS Transistors. During the tutorials, sometimes I can really see some deeper understanding of certains topics given by Mr. Juezhao!

#### Assessments

1. **Take-Home Exercises**: This is the best chance to practice the theory knowledge out. These problems are not that difficult.
2. **Final**: The final is just a combination of the problems that come out from the tutorials plus some variants. Not that hard, but quite interesting.

### Course Book

There is one textbook and one reference book used for this course!

**Textbook**: *Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective (Second Edition)* by Jan M. Rabaey, Anantha Chandrakasan, and Borivoje Nikolic

!!! warning "Attention"
    This textbook is meant for a graduate-level course. And in CG2027, we only cover the surface of some devices. And this textbook is very maths heavy. However, it is a very classical textbook.

**Reference book**: *CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective (Fourth Edition)* by Neil H.E. Weste and David Harris

![CG2027 Referencebook](../../assets/images/CG2027_Referencebook.jpg){ width=200 style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" }

!!! info
    During my time, the NUS Library doesn't have this book and after my request, they get it in less than one month! And now they are available at the NUS Central Library!

## Learning Experience

### Personal Insights

This course has successfully fulfilled the eight levels of abstraction's bottom parts. It feels fantastic to understand the computer system that I am working on from the very low-level physics, how the CMOS transistors work and finally use CMOS transistors to build the digital functional units.

### Skills Developed

In this course, I have learned the theory of the CMOS transistors. However, how they are appilied in the digital integrated circuit design, this will be taught in another module!

## Workload and Time Management

- **Level of Difficulty**: 7/10
- **Tips for future cohort**: I hope my compiled lecture notes can help ease your burden during this course!

## Conclusion

This is a must-take course if you want to do integrated circuit design in the future!
