5. **Infinite Series**: Sequences, Infinite Series, Two Convergence Tests for Infinite Series, Power Series, Taylor Series, Maclaurin Series

### Depth and Balance of Coverage

- **Theoretical Understanding**:  
   As an engineering mathematics course, the focus is primarily on applying equations to solve problems. However, I believe engineers should also develop a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. This theoretical foundation will help in analyzing and solving real-world problems more effectively, beyond just computation.

- **Application and Real-World Examples**:  
   While this course touches on the geometric interpretation and representation of concepts, I feel like it falls short of incorporating practical real-world examples. This limitation might stem from the course's brief duration. From my point of view, incorporating at least a few detailed real-world applications would greatly enhance the learning experience.

- **Challenging or Unique Aspects**:  
   The most challenging aspect of this course, in my opinion, is developing **spatial imagination**. Understanding certain concepts through their geometric interpretations can make them significantly easier to grasp. Without this visualization, however, the material can become quite difficult to comprehend.

## Teaching Style and Materials
- **Lecture**:  
   The lectures are conducted by Prof. Tan Ban Pin. The lecture notes are clear, concise, and easy to understand, making them an excellent resource for both learning during the semester and reviewing before the final examination.  

- **Tutorial**:  
   My tutorials are led by Clifton, who is an excellent instructor. He explains concepts clearly and is always approachable. The tutorial questions for this module are generally straightforward and not too challenging.

- **Assessment**:  
   The final examination is the primary assessment for this course. In my opinion, it is quite straightforward and mainly tests your familiarity with the formulas covered in the course. Most of the time, solving the problems involves directly substituting numbers into the equations, making it more of a test of accuracy than deep conceptual understanding.  

### Course Book
**Reference Book**: There is no specific textbook for this course. But based on my learning experience, I think the book *Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Metric Edition* by James Stewart is awesome! I love reading it since I was in NTU.

## Learning Experience
- **Personal Insights**:  
   The workload for this course is relatively light, so if your goal is simply to pass or secure a good grade, you don't need to invest an excessive amount of time. However, if you aim to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts by reading the textbook, be prepared for it to be quite time-consuming. I noticed that the content of one week's lecture typically corresponds to an entire chapter in the textbook. That said, this course provides a valuable opportunity to revisit and deepen your understanding during the holidays.

- **Skills Developed**:  
   The calculus skills I developed in this course, including both integration and differentiation, are fundamental and incredibly important for succeeding in the follow-up module, MA1512 *Differential Equations for Engineers*.  

## Workload and Time Management  
- **Level of Difficulty**:  **4/10**
- **Tips for Future Students**:  
    I hope my notes will ease your workload and provide clarity on the concepts covered in this course. They are designed to help you grasp the material more effectively and approach the challenges with confidence.

## Conclusion
Calculus is a fundamental skill, especially for engineers. As for this course, I legit have no comment. However, one key takeaway is the importance of self-study, which is an essential skill to develop and rely on during university.
