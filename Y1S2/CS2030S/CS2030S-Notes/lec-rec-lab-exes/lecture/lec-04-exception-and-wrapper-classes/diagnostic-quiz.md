## Problems

### 01. Subtype relationship with `interface`

> Pay attention to the _reflexive_ property of the subtype relationship. This willl ensure you get **all** the correct options! Don't miss one!

That is, if $$A<:B$$ and $$B<:C$$, then $$A<:C$$

### 02. Type casting and compile-time error

> To see whether a code will generate compile-error or not, we **only** see the CTT of the variable and the type casting. The casted type must be the subtype of CTT of L.H.S and should be withn the type hierarchy (either subtype of supertype) of the CTT of R.H.S

Type casting will cast the variable to that specific type dyuring the **compile-time**.

### 03. Type casting and rum-time error

> Run-time error judgement **only** needs us to see the RTT of the variable. We **must** ignore the type casting!

As we have seen above, type casting is only done during the compile-time. So, during the run-time, we can just **ignore** the type casting and see the subtype relationship between the RTT of the L.H.S and R.H.S variable.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is because Java is **strongly typed**, meaning objects always retain their actual type (RTT).
{% endhint %}

### 04. Wrapper class

> All primitive wrapper class objects are _immutable._

This means that **once a wrapper object is created, its value cannot be changed**. If you want to modify the value, you have to create a new object.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
public class WrapperImmutability {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer a = 10; // Autoboxing: int → Integer

        // Trying to "modify" a
        a = a + 5; // This creates a NEW Integer object
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

### 14. Exception Hierarchy

The following image summarise the Exception Hierarchy well!

### 16. `throw` as `return`

In the `try-catch-finally` exception handling block, the `throw` statement has the same purpose as `return`, meaning that it will `jump` directly from the current block and may enter the next block.

For example, the following code will print `BD` at the end.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
try {
   throw new NewException();
   System.out.print("A");
} catch (NewException e) {
   System.out.print("B");
} catch (OldException e) {
   System.out.print("C");
} finally {
   System.out.print("D");
}
```
{% endcode %}

## Tips

1. Pay attention to the _reflexive_ property of the subtype relationship. This willl ensure you get **all** the correct options! Don't miss one!
2. To see whether a code will generate **compile-error** or not, we **only** see the **CTT** of the variable and the type casting.
3. **Run-time** error judgement **only** needs us to see the **RTT** of the variable. We **must ignore** the type casting because Java is **strongly typed**, meaning objects always retain their actual type (RTT).
4. Include the exception hierarchy in the cheatsheet!
