## Information Hiding

The _information hiding principle_ is about **hiding the internal from outsiders**.

### A Problem

In the last lecture, we have introduced the idea of [_abstraction barrier_](../lec-01-compiler-types-classes-objects/#abstraction-barrier)_._ Above the abstraction barrier is the **client**, and as usual, the client shouldn't modify any content below the _abstraction barrier_ since it belongs to the **implementer** unless the implementer allows to do so.

For example, we have a `Circle` class, an object `c` initialized from this class, and the **client** wants to set the `r` (one of the fields) to a certain number, let's say 10 (`c.r = 10`). But now, the **implementer** says the `r` field in the class will be changed to `d` (diameter). Then, bad things will happen since calling `c.r = 10` will generate a **compilation error!** To fix it, the client have change every `c.r` to `c.d` ! This is tedious!

This **problem** is caused by the **client**'s breaking the _abstract barrier_ to access the field, which should belong to the **implementer**.

### `public` and `private`

To solve this problem, many Object-oriented languages allow programmers to **explicitly** specify if a **field** or a **method** can be accessed from outside the abstraction barrier. Java, for instance, supports `private` and `public` access modifiers. Their difference are summarized in the table below

|   Accessed from   | private | public |
| :---------------: | :-----: | :----: |
|  Inside the class |   Yes   |   Yes  |
| Outside the class |    No   |   Yes  |

Such a mechanism to protect the **abstraction barrier** from being broken is called _data hiding_ or _information hiding_. This protection is enforced by the _compiler_ at compile time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Usually, we make fields as `private` becasue of the _information hidden_ principle, unless we have proper reason to make it `public` to the client, such as it is a constant, like `Math.PI`, which will we see later in [_class fields_](./#class-field).
{% endhint %}

### Constructor

But now, a new problem emerges. If we define all our fields in the class to be `private`, then how we can initialize them? :joy: To solve this problem, it is common for a class to provide methods to **initialize these internal fields**.

> A method that initializes an object is called a _**constructor**._

{% hint style="info" %}
So, basically, we can see _constructor_ as a way to "set up" our object.
{% endhint %}

A constructor method is a special method within the class. It **cannot be called directly** but **is invoked automatically when an object is instantiated**. In Java, a constructor method _has **the same name as the class**_ and _has **no return type**_. A constructor can take in arguments just like other functions. Let's add a constructor to our `Circle` class:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
class Circle {
  private double x;
  private double y;
  private double r;

  public Circle(double x, double y, double r) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = r;
  }

  public double getArea() {
    return 3.141592653589793 * this.r * this.r;
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

#### The `this` keyword

As you have noticed, the code above introduces the `this` keyword. `this` is a **reference variable** that [refers back to the **calling object itself**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. It can be used to distinguish between two variables of the same name. In the example above, `this.x = x` means we want to set the field `x` of this object to the parameter `x` passed into the constructor.

{% hint style="success" %}
Notice that in the `getArea()`, we have replaced `r` with `this.r`. Usually, it is a good practice to refer to fields through `this` because it differs the field from local variables or parameters, thus making our code easier to understand.
{% endhint %}

#### Default Constructor

If we have a class that has **no** explicit constructor, then a default constructor will be added automatically at **compile time**. The default constructor has **no parameter** and has **no code** written for the body.

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Note

In a class, there may exist many constructors, but

1. They have the **same method name**, which is the same as the class name
2. They have **different number of parameters**

Later you will learn that this is kind of like **method overloadding**.
{% endhint %}

## Tell, Don't Ask

### Accessors and Mutators

Similar to providing [constructors](./#constructor), a class can also provide methods to **retrieve or modify** the properties of the object. These methods are called the _accessor_ (or _getter_) or _mutator_ (or _setter_).

For example, for our `Circle` class, we have the following _accessors_ and _mutators_.

| Fields | Accessors | Mutators |
| ------ | --------- | -------- |
| `x`    | `getX`    | `setX`   |
| `y`    | `getY`    | `setY`   |
| `r`    | `getR`    | `setR`   |

#### Advantage

The use of _accessors_ and _mutators_ has the following advantages over using the `public` keyword to make the field public directly. By having an accessor and a mutator:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
We are **adding a layer of abstraction.** For instance, we can still rename a field without affecting the client.

**Why?** This is because we are calling the methods (a.k.a _accessors_ and _mutators_) to retrieve or modify the fields in the object, so as long as we don't change the method name, changing the **field name** merely in class won't affect the client's code.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
We may be able to peform some **checks on the mutator.**

This is because sometimes user may set invalid or not-compatible values to the fields. However, by using a mutator, we can do some checks to prevent this kind of bug-prone behavior. For example,

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
public void setR(double r) {
  if (r > 0) {
    this.r = r;
  } else {
    // handle error
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Disadvantage

However, the use of _accessors_ and _mutators_ is **not** an error-free solution. For example, when the client is calling an _accessor_, the client should know the type that will be returned, a.k.a, **the type of the certain field** in the class. However, the **client** should **not** know this kind of information since it belongs to the **implementer**! So, here comes the first problem:

> 1. Information Leak

The problem does not stop here. Let's say if the **implementer** wants to change the type of the field, which will also change the return type of the _accessors_, and the **client** doesn't know that! This is very dangerous because likely the original code will cause a **compilation error**!

> 2. May cause compilation error

For example, let's use the following code regarding our `Circle` class as an example:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
int cX = c.getX(); // Suppose getX() will return an double, same for the following
int cY = c.getY();
int r = c.getR();
boolean isInCircle = ((x - cX) * (x - cX) + (y - cY) * (y - cY)) <= r * r;
```
{% endcode %}

As we have seen earlier in the [subtype](../lec-01-compiler-types-classes-objects/#subtypes), `int` is the **subtype** of `double`. Assign a `double` to a `int` is considered as [_narrowing type conversion_](../lec-01-compiler-types-classes-objects/#subtyping-between-java-primitive-types) and [it is **not allowed** without explicit casting](../lec-01-compiler-types-classes-objects/diagnostic-quiz.md#id-15.-widening-narrowing-type-conversion)! So, here we will get a **compilation error!**

***

So, the question comes, when should we use _accessors_ and _mutators_?

### The "Tell, Don't Ask" Principle

One guiding principle on whether the **implementer** should provide and whether the **client** should call the _accessor_ and _mutator_ is the "**Tell, Don't Ask**" principle. Here is the "Tell, Don't Ask" principle,

> we should **tell an object what to do**, instead of asking an object for its state and then performing the task on its behalf.

For example, in the example above, what we are trying to do is as follows:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/lec02-tell-don&#x27;t-ask-previous.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By applying the "Tell Don't Ask" principle, a better approach would be to add a new `boolean` method in the `Circle` class,

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
boolean contains(double x, double y) {
  return ((x - this.x) * (x - this.x) + (y - this.y) * (y - this.y)) <= this.r * this.r;
}
```
{% endcode %}

and let the **client** _tell_ the `Circle` object to check if the point is within the circle.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
boolean isInCircle = c.contains(x, y);
```
{% endcode %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/lec02-tell-don&#x27;t-ask-current.png" alt="" width="363"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now, the `Circle` class can change its internal structure (e.g., the type of the fields) without affecting the client.

{% hint style="success" %}
1. In general, a task that is **performed only on the fields of a class** should be implemented in the class itsel&#x66;_._
2. For beginner OO programmers, it is better to **not define classes with any accessor and modifier** to the `private` fields and force yourselves to think in the OO way — to **tell an object what task to perform as a client, and then implement this task within the class as a method as the implementer**.
{% endhint %}

## Class Field

In our `Circle` class, we have a constant $$\pi$$ and this constant $$\pi$$ is universal and **does not really belong to any object** (The value of $$\pi$$ is same for every circle!). In C, we have the solution to define a global constant using the `define` keyword.

In Java, we can associate these _global_ values and functions with a _class_ instead of with an _object_. For instance. Java predefines a [`java.lang.Math`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html) class that is populated with constants `PI` and `E` (for Euler's number $$e$$), along with a long list of mathematical functions.

{% hint style="success" %}
Define a **class field** is also the way we should use to define **a constant** in Java!
{% endhint %}

To associate a method or a field with a class in Java, we declare them with the `static` keyword. We can additionally add the keyword `final` to indicate that the value of the field will not change and `public` to indicate that the field is accessible from outside the class. In short, the combination of `public static final` modifiers is used for constant values in Java.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
class Math {
  :
  public static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
  :
  :
}
```
{% endcode %}

We call these `static` fields that are associated with a **class** as _class fields_ and fields that are associated with an **object** as _instance fields_. _Class fields_ are useful for storing pre-computed values or configuration parameters associated with a class rather than individual objects. `static` fields have **exactly one instance** of it throughout the lifetime of the program.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A `static` class field needs **not** be `final` and it needs **not** be `public`.
{% endhint %}

### Access Class Fields

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Import the certain class**

For example, if we want to use the `PI` constant defined in class `java.lang.Math`, we should first use the `import` keyword to import the `java.lang.Math` class

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
import java.lang.Math;
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Use** `class.FIELD_NAME`  **to access the class field**

After importing the class, we can use `class.FIELD_NAME` to acccess the specific class field.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
public double getArea() {
  return Math.PI * this.r * this.r;
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
To access a _class field_. It is **only allowed** to use `class.FIELD_NAME`, we **cannot** use `object.FIELD_NAME` to access a `static` field inside an object!
{% endhint %}

## Class Method

Similar to a `static` field, a `static` method is **associated with a class**, **not with any instance of the class**. Such a method is called a _class method_.

A class method is always invoked **without being attached to an instance**, so it **cannot access its instance fields or call other of its instance methods**. The reference `this` has no meaning within a class method. Furthermore, just like a class field, a class method should be accessed through the class. For example, in our `Circle` class, we wish to assign a unique integer identifier to every `Circle` object ever created:

<pre class="language-java" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-java">class Circle {
  private double x;  // x-coordinate of the center
  private double y;  // y-coordinate of the center
  private double r;  // the length of the radius
<strong>  private final int id; // identifier
</strong><strong>  private static int lastId = 0; // the id of the latest circle instance
</strong>
  /**
   * Create a circle centered on (x, y) with a given radius
   */
  public Circle(double x, double y, double r) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = r;
<strong>    this.id = Circle.lastId;
</strong><strong>    Circle.lastId += 1;
</strong>  }

  /**
   * Return how many circles have ever existed.
   */
<strong>  public static int getNumOfCircles() {
</strong><strong>    return Circle.lastId;
</strong><strong>  }
</strong>
   : 
}
</code></pre>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that all of the above are done privately **beneath the abstraction barrier**.
{% endhint %}

Other examples of class methods include the methods provided in `java.lang.Math`: `sqrt`, `min`, etc. These methods can be invoked through the `Math` class: e.g., `Math.sqrt(x)`.

### The `static` keyword

Recap that for static fields (i.e., class fields), we only have exactly **one instance** of it t**hroughout the lifetime of the program**. More generally, **a field or method with modifier** `static` **belongs to the class rather than the specific instance**. In other words, they can be accessed/updated (for fields, assuming proper access modifier) or invoked (for methods, assuming proper access modifier) **without even instantiating the class**.

### More on `this`

As we have seen `this` [first time](./#the-this-keyword) in the [constructor](./#constructor), let's talk more about `this` with `static` methods.

As a follow up, if we have not instantiated a class, no instance of that class has been created. The keyword `this` is meant to refer to the _current instance_, and if there is no instance, the keyword `this` has no meaning! Therefore, within the context of a `static` method, Java actually **prevents the use of** `this` **from any method with the** `static` **modifier**.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
  public static int getLastId() {
    return this.id; 
  }
  // This will generate an error
```
{% endcode %}

The opposite is **not** true. We can access class fields from non-static methods.

### The `main()` method

The most common class method you will use is probably the `main` method.

Every Java program has a class method called `main`, which serves as the **entry point** to the program. To run a Java program, we need to tell the JVM the class **whose** `main` **method should be invoked first**. In the example that we have seen,

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
java Hello
```
{% endcode %}

will invoke the `main` method defined within the class `Hello` to kick start the execution of the program.

The `main` method must be defined in the following way:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
public static final void main(String[] args) {
}
```
{% endcode %}

## Composition

Till now, in our class, we only use the [primitive type](../lec-01-compiler-types-classes-objects/#primitive-types-in-java) as the _fields_. However, it is advised and a good practice to use other classes (a.k.a [reference type](../lec-01-compiler-types-classes-objects/#reference-types-in-java)) in the _fields_. And this technique is called _composition_.

Basically, the main **advantage** of using _composition_ is that it adds more **abstraction**. Recall that we wish to **hide the implementation details as much as possible**, protecting them with an abstraction barrier, so that **the client does not have to bother about the details and it is easy for the implementer to change the details**.

{% hint style="info" %}
As you will see later also, what _composition_ does is to implement a **"has-a"** relationship.
{% endhint %}

## Heap and Stack

### Stack

The _stack_ contains variables. Bascially, _stack_ is the region where all **variables** (including **primitive types** and **object references**) are allocated and stored.&#x20;

#### Stack Frame

_Stack frame_ is usually called _call frame_. Recall that the same variable names can exist in the program as long as they are in different methods. This means that **the variables are contained within the&#x20;**_**call frames**_. Call frames are **created** when we **invoke a method** and are removed when the method completes.

And usually, when an **instance** method is called, a _stack frame_ is created and it contains:

1. the `this` reference
2. the method arguments
3. local variables within the method

When a **class** method is called, the _stack frame_ does not contain the `this` reference.

{% hint style="info" %}
1. Instance and class fields are **not** variable. As such, fields are not in the stack.
2. If we make multiple nested method calls, as we usually do, the stack frames get stacked on top of each other.
{% endhint %}

### Heap

The heap stores dynamically allocated objects. To put it simply, **whenever you use the keyword `new`, a new object is created in the heap**, but the **reference varaible** will be stored on the **stack**.

An object in the _heap_ contains the following information:

* Class name.
* Instance fields and the respective values.
* Captured variables (more on this in later units).

### Stack and Heap Diagram

#### Example One - Object Reference

For the following code:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Circle c;
Point center;
double radius;
radius = 8;
center = new Point(1, 1);
c = new Circle(center, radius);
```
{% endcode %}

Its stack and heap diagram should look like as follows:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/lec02-stack-heap-diagram-1.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that after Line 6, the field `c` (not the variable `c`) inside the `Circle` class is referenced to the `Point` object, not the `center` variable!
{% endhint %}

#### Example Two - Call Method

For the following code,

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Point p1 = new Point(0, 0);
Point p2 = new Point(1, 1);
p1.distanceTo(p2);
```
{% endcode %}

Its stack and frame diagram should look like as follows:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/lec02-stack-heap-diagram-2.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Summary

To summarize, Java uses _call by value_ for primitive types, and [_call by reference_](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] for objects.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unlike in C, In Java, we don't have to manage our memory manually, the JVM has a _garbage collector_ that does all this stuff for us!
{% endhint %}

## Inheritance

Recall the concept of _subtyping._ We say that $$S<:T$$ if any piece of code written for type $$T$$ also works for type $$S$$.

Now, let's use the example of `Circle` class. Suppose we want to **add** a color to the `Circle` class to make it a `ColoredCircle`. Now, we may find that all the methods and properties within the `Cricle` class should apply to `ColoredCircle` as well! So, we can think `ColoredCricle` as a _subtype_ of `Circle`.

### Inheritate from a class

We now show you how we can introduce this _subtype_ relationship in Java, using the `extends` keyword. We can implement our `ColoredCircle` class this way:

<pre class="language-java" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-java">class ColoredCircle extends Circle {
  private Color color;

  public ColoredCircle(Point center, double radius, Color color) {
<strong>    super(center, radius);  // call the parent's constructor
</strong>    this.color = color;
  }
}
</code></pre>

We have just created a new type called `ColoredCircle` as a class that **extends** from `Circle`. We call `Circle` the _parent class_ or _superclass_ of `ColoredCircle`; and `ColoredCircle` a _subclass_ of `Circle`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The constructor for the subclass **should** invoke the constructor of the superclass.
{% endhint %}

Line 5 of the code above introduces another keyword in Java: `super`. Here, we use `super` to call the **constructor** of the superclass, to initialize its center and radius.

{% hint style="success" %}
We can think of inheritance as a model for the "_**is a**_" relationship between two entities. And when to use _inheritance_ and when to use _composition_ depends on the following rule:

> _Use composition to model a **has-a** relationship; and inheritance for an **is-a** relationship_. _Make sure inheritance preserves the meaning of subtyping_.
{% endhint %}

### Run-Time Type

For the following code:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Circle c = new ColoredCircle(p, 0, blue); // OK
```
{% endcode %}

Recall that `Circle` is called the **compile-time type** of `c`. Here, we see that `c` is now referencing an object of the subtype `ColoredCircle`. Since this assignment happens during **run-time**, we say that the _run-time type_ of `c` is `ColoredCircle`. The distinction between these two types will be important later in [Polymorphism](../lec-03-polymorphism/#polymorphism).

Here, Java allows us to assign a variable to store its **subtype** because this is considered as a **widening type conversion** and as we have seen earlier, this happens automatically and is allowed.

## Overriding

Before we talk about overriding, let's introduce another very important point in Java, that is:

> In Java, **every class** that does not extend another class inherits from class `Object` implicitly. `Object` is, therefore, the "ancestor" of **all classes** in Java and is at the root of the class hierarchy.&#x20;

The `Object` class provides useful common methods to all objects, below are two of them:

1. `equals(Object obj)`, which checks if two objects are equal to each other, and
2. `toString()`, which returns a string representation of the object as a `String` object.

Among them, the second method is quite interesting and explains why _Java allows_ [_"addition"_](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] _on string and integer,_ which was covered in [Lec 01](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/cs2030s-notes/lec-tut-lab-exes/lecture/lec-01-compiler-types-classes-objects#type-checking-with-a-compiler). For example,

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
Circle c = new Circle(new Point(0, 0), 4.0);
String s = "Circle c is " + c; // s will be "Circle c is Circle@1ce92674"
```
{% endcode %}

### Customize `toString` method

We may note that `Circle@1ce92674` is not user-friendly so that we want customize it. To do so, let's define our own `toString` method in `Circle` to _override_ the `Object::toString()`. This technique is called _Overriding_.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
import java.lang.Math;

/**
 * A Circle object encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.  
 */
class Circle {

  // ...
  
  /**
   * Return the string representation of this circle.
   */
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "{ center: " + this.c + ", radius: " + this.r + " }";
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

From this example, we can see that _inheritance_ is not only good for extending the behavior of an existing class but through method _overriding_, we can _alter_ the behavior of an existing class as well.

{% hint style="success" %}
#### **Using** `super` **to access overriden methods**

After a subclass overrides a method in the superclass, the methods that have been overridden can still be called, with the `super` keyword. For instance, the following `Circle::toString` calls `Object::toString` to prefix the string representation of the circle with `Circle@1ce92674`.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="false" %}
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
      return super.toString() + " { center: " + this.c + ", radius: " + this.r + " }";
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}

### Method Signature and Descriptor

The _method signature_ of a method **contains**:

1. the method name
2. the number of parameters,
3. the type of each parameter,&#x20;
4. and the order of its parameters.

The _method descriptor_ is defined as the _method signature_ plus the **return type**.

For example, for the following code

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```java
class C {
  A foo(B1 x, B2 y) {
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Its _method signature_ is `C::foo(B1, B2)` and its _method descriptor_ is `A C::foo(B1, B2)`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that for the **parameters,** we are using their **type** instead of their **names**. And **class names** are not a requirement in _method signature_ and _method descriptor_, they are used just to make this notation clearer.
{% endhint %}

***

So, using the idea of _method siganature_ and _method descriptor,_ **overriding** basically happens when a subclass defines an instance method with the same _**method descriptor**_ as an instance method in the parent class.

[^1]: It is because, usually, we use `this` keyword inside the methods. And usually, methods are called using `object.method()`, so here "**the calling object itself"** refers to the "object" in front of the `.`.

[^2]: Alternatively, you can think of Java as always using _call by value_. It's just that the value of a reference is, in fact, just a reference.

[^3]: The formal notation is concatenation.
