# Emphasis and importance

The previous article looked at why semantics are important in HTML, and focused on headings and paragraphs. This article continues on the theme of semantics, looking at HTML elements that apply emphasis and importance to text (parallel to italics and bold text in print media).

## What are emphasis and importance

In human language, we often emphasize certain words to alter the meaning of a sentence, and we often want to mark certain words as important or different in some way. HTML provides various **semantic elements** to allow us to mark up textual content with such effects, and in this section, we'll look at a few of the most common ones.

### Emphasis

When we want to add emphasis in spoken language, we _stress_ certain words, subtly altering the meaning of what we are saying. Similarly, in written language we tend to stress words by putting them in italics. For example, the following two sentences have different meanings.

> I am glad you weren't late.
>
> I am _glad_ you weren't _late_.

The first sentence sounds genuinely relieved that the person wasn't late. In contrast, the second one, with both the words "glad" and "late" in italics, sounds sarcastic or passive-aggressive, expressing annoyance that the person arrived a bit late.

In HTML we use the [`<em>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em) (emphasis) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more interesting to read, these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as italic by default, **but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get italic styling**. To do that, you'd use a [`<span>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) element and some CSS, or perhaps an [`<i>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i) element (see below).

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late</em>.</p>
```
{% endcode %}

### Strong importance

To emphasize important words, we tend to stress them in spoken language and **bold** them in written language. For example:

> This liquid is **highly toxic**.
>
> I am counting on you. **Do not** be late!

In HTML we use the [`<strong>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) (strong importance) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as bold text by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get bold styling. To do that, you'd use a [`<span>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) element and some CSS, or perhaps a [`<b>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b) element (see below).

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>

<p>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</p>
```
{% endcode %}

## Italic, bold, underline...

The elements we've discussed so far have clear-cut associated semantics. The situation with [`<b>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b), [`<i>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i), and [`<u>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u) is somewhat more complicated. They came about so people could write bold, italics, or underlined text in an era when CSS was still supported poorly or not at all. Elements like this, which only affect presentation and not semantics, are known as **presentational elements** and should no longer be used because, as we've seen before, semantics is so important to accessibility, SEO, etc.

HTML5 redefined `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>` with new, somewhat confusing, semantic roles.

Here's the best rule you can remember: It's only appropriate to use `<b>`, `<i>`, or `<u>` to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed with bold, italics, or underline when there isn't a more suitable element; and there usually is. Consider whether `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<mark>`, or `<span>` might be more appropriate.

Always keep an accessibility mindset. The concept of italics isn't very helpful to people using screen readers, or to people using a writing system other than the Latin alphabet.

* [`<i>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i) is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by italic: foreign words, taxonomic designation, technical terms, a thought…
* [`<b>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b) is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by bold: keywords, product names, lead sentence…
* [`<u>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u) is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by underline: proper name, misspelling…
